# It’s Beginning To Look Godot Like Christmas

My entry for Endless Foundation's 2024 Christmas decoration competition. I
think the decorations were supposed to be physical but I'm much better at
programming than at papercraft.

For the record I pronounce Godot as “GO-doh”, but I needed to use the “go-DOT”
pronunciation to make the festive pun work.
